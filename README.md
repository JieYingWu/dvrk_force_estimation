# dVRK Force Estimation
Using neural network to estimate forces on the dVRK

We test two methods here 
 * Indirect - which learns the torque to move the joints in free space as described in this paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341879597_Neural_Network_based_Inverse_Dynamics_Identification_and_External_Force_Estimation_on_the_da_Vinci_Research_Kit
 * Direct - which learns the forces directly from a sensor in the environment
